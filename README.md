# High-definition Cloth Retouching (CRHD-3K) Dataset 
High-definition Cloth Retouching (CRHD-3K) is a high-quality dataset for cloth retouching, which aims to remove the wrinkles, creases, and other blemishes on the clothes to make them look more smooth and beautiful. It includes 3,022 pairs of raw and retouching photos, where the raw photos were collected from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.dogedoge.com) and the retouching process was accomplished by a team of professional image editors. The dataset is released as part of the following paper:
